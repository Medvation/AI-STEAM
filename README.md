# 🟢 RED LIGHT, 🔴 GREEN LIGHT  
**A Fun and Thrilling Challenge Inspired by the Squid Game!**  
Ready to test your reflexes and stealth skills? This game brings the iconic "Red Light, Green Light" from the hit Netflix series **Squid Game** to life, powered by OpenCV.

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE  
Your mission, should you choose to accept it:  
🚶‍♀️ Move toward the camera during **Green Light** phases.  
🎉 Hit the **'w' key** to declare victory when you're close enough.  

Sounds simple, right? Think again—there’s a twist!

## 📜 RULES OF THE GAME  
🔴 **Red Light Rules**:  
- If you move when it's **Red Light**, you're out!  

⏳ **Beat the Timer**:  
- If you fail to hit the **'w' key** before the timer reaches zero, you lose.  

👋 **Quitting Early**:  
- Pressing **'q'** during the game ends it prematurely, and you lose!  

This game uses clever motion detection to catch you moving when you shouldn't. So, no sneaky business! 🤔

## 🤝 MULTIPLAYER MODE  
Want to compete with friends? Easy!  
- Take turns moving toward the camera.  
- If anyone moves during a **Red Light**, the game ends for all!  
(Yeah, teamwork *doesn't* always make the dream work here!)
